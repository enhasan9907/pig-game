This is a simple Pig Game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
## Introduction

Pig Game is a two-player dice game where players take turns rolling a dice. The objective is to be the first player to reach a certain score, usually 100. Players accumulate points by rolling the dice, but if they roll a 1, they lose all their current points for that turn.

This project implements the Pig Game using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a simple interface for players to roll the dice, hold their current score, and restart the game.
